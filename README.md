# Dextromethophan-Model
Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) Modeling of Dextromethorphan and its metabolites in adults with different CYP2D6 phenotypes
## Repository Files 
A whole-body PBPK model of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan and dextrorphan O-glucuronide was developed. The model has been developed and evaluated for the prediction of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan and dextrorphan O-glucuronide plasma concentrations after intravenous and oral administration over a wide dose range (5 to 80 mg).

The PBPK model was developed to describe the effect of genetic variants in the CYP2D6 gene on the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan. For this purpose, CYP2D6 k<sub>cat</sub> values were optimized for different CYP2D6 activity scores.
