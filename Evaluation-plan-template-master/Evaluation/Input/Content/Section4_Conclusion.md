The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of Dextromethorphan and its metabolites in adults with different CYP2D6 phenotypes.

In particular, it applies quantitative metabolism by CYP2D6 which can be adapted to a CYP2D6 phenotype using CYP2D6 k<sub>cat</sub> activity score scalars. Thus, the model is fit for purpose to be applied for the investigation of DDIs with regards to CYP2D6 metabolism in adults with different CYP2D6 phenotypes.
