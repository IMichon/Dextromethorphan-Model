The PBPK model for Dextromethorphan, dextrophan and dextrorphan O-glucuronide was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The PBPK model for midazolam was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data. The model was built and evaluated covering data from studies including in particular 
intravenous (0.5 mg/kg 30 min infusion ) 
oral administrations (dose range 5 to 80 mg).

The model quantifies metabolism of dextraomethorphan via mainly CYP2D6, and includes the possibility to include K<sub>cat</sub> activity scores for CYP2D6 to simulate different CYP2D6 phenotypes.

The next sections show:

1. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
2. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
